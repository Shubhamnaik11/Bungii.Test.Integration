alert.Request.Bungii=Heads up!\nYour estimate is based on $1/min + $1/mile which includes <TIME> minutes ($<TIME>) of loading & unloading time. Your actual fare may be greater if it takes longer than the estimate.\n\nYou can keep costs low by curbside pickup/drop-off, avoiding rush hour & having extra hands available.
customer.info.loadtime=Since every Bungii is different, we let you decide how much load/unload time you may need. Your estimate varies upon the time you select, which helps ensure accuracy.\n\nDelivering one or two items, like a couch and chair, to a ground-level room usually takes ~15 minutes for loading/unload.\n\nWe recommend increasing the loading/unload time if you have multiple items, items that require additional wrapping/securing, stairs, or narrow doorways/hallways.
customer.info.totalestimate=This estimate is based upon current traffic conditions and <TIME> minutes for loading and unloading.
customer.info.time=This is the time you’d like the drivers to arrive at the pickup location.
